The MX1S boards are small PCB's meant to attach to any standard MX switch to facilitate solderless wiring.  

The design was inspired by [Crane's](https://github.com/Crane1195) [MX1 boards](https://github.com/Crane1195/Model-MX1). I heavily simplified them hence the MX1S name.

For a demonstration of how these can be implemented check out the DIDIY Assembly Guide video on the [HTangl youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIHJYzL-LAS2CVR-Q0J305w)  

I sell these on my [Etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/HTangl), for updates on when a batch is being release please join the [HTangl Discord server](https://discord.gg/yAeFsbCDpv)  

If you'd like to order these directly from a PCB manufacturer I have provided the necessary gerber zip folder. Below is a guide on how to order from JLCPCB. Besides the boards themselves you will also need Kailh hotswap sockets and some 3 pin 3.5mm pitch screw terminals.

## JLCPCB Ordering Guide ##  

**Step 1**  
Download the files in this repository by clicking the green code button at the top right and then click "Download ZIP". Once the download is finished unzip the folder. Do not unzip the "MX1S Gerber.zip"  

**Step 2**  
Go to [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) and click the "Order now" button at the top right. Click on the big blue "Add gerber file" button and upload the "MX1S Gerber.zip" from the Gerber folder.  

**Step 3**  
Change "Delivery Format" to "Panel by JLCPCB" and set the column to 4 and the row to 6. This will result in panels with 24 individual PCB's each. JLCPCB has a 5 piece minimum so you will end up with 120 individual PCB's.  

**Step 4**  
You can change the PCB color if you'd like, it does not add cost but does increase production time, you can leave all other options set to default. You can now click the big blue "SAVE TO CART" button and go through the rest of the checkout process.
